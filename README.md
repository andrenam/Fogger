Fogger
======

Fogger turns your cloud apps into regular desktop apps

Fogger acts as a bridge between web applications and the linux desktop. 
It exposes an easy to use JS API to webapps which can be used to 
interact with the host desktop environment. It can also be used to write 
basic desktop apps for linux in pure web style.
